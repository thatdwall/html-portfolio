<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring Web Developer, and this web site will list my projects I have worked on during my learning.  I have 
  been in IT for many years, but this is my first foray into web development.  I have many years of experience with CI/CD 
  and DevOps engineering.  My programming experience has been mostly scripting languages like Unix Shell, Python, Jenkins
  pipeline script, ADO pipeline yaml, and GitHub workflow scripting.
</p>

<p>I have worked for AT&T for the past 23 years, and I am still currently employed with them.  I love the people I work with 
  and the technologies I get to learn and work with. 
</p>

<p>I am married and have one son who is grown up and living on his own.  I have an orange Tabby whose name is Luka. 
  I love sports, video games, movies, fantasy and sci-fi books, and eating good food.
